The goal of this assignment is to create a website that contains our visualizations that we have created throughout the semester. Some key elements that we had to focus on were: creating a website, uploading previously made graphs (specifically multi linked views), creating at least one new multi linked view, making sure to implement a visualization that uses spatial visualization, and adding some HTML interactions. In our page, we have implemented what we believe are our best graphs and we’re confident that they accomplish all of the requirements. Each graph has their own unique design and has a different goal toward what it wants to achieve for the user. Almost all graphs contain some sort of interaction that enhances user experience and all of them contain information that will cause the user to think and ask questions.

Before we go over each graph it is important to first inform the information our visualizations contain. The following data we are taking is named “CDPH environmental complaints''. It was first created in 2012 and was last updated in September 2023. The set contains data dating back from January 1993 and was collected by the Department of Environment from 1993 to 2011. The DOE then disbanded in 2012 and transferred all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities to the Department of Public Health. The data is organized by “Complaint types'' which include issues related to site abandonment, air pollution, and construction just to name a few. Each complaint type is linked with an attribute which includes: the complaint ID, location of the complaint, the date it was received, specific details of the complaint, its data source, and the ID and narrative log of the inspector who conducted the complaint inspection. As of today, the data contains over 57,0000 complaints to analyze. The data presents itself to be useful to people who wish to live in the area the data is collected from. It will also prove useful to anyone looking to start a business designed for tourists or customers such as a restaurant, hotel, mall, etc. It can also be potentially used as a tool to help the city or engineers who seek to find ways to improve the quality of life in certain areas.

(First linked view when you a select a bar)

This visualization is a multi-linked view that implements two visual elements, a bar graph and a donut circle. The bar graph goes over the total number of complaints throughout time which is represented through years. The donut graph visualizes all the complaint types of the data. All categories are color coded and the visualization provides a legend for the user. The overall goal of this visualization is to show the user how many complaints were accumulated per year. This allows the users to see what year contained the most complaints, what year had the least, and compare years of their choosing. The goal of the second graph is to go into detail of what type of complaints were reported for the second year. This allows the user to analyze trends and hypothesis correlations. For example, upon further analisis we discover that the year 2000 has the highest amount of reportings. The user could ask "Why kind of complaints where made in 2000?" this is when they can click on the 2000 bar and find specific details they are looking for.
The visualization is interactive, if the user hovers their mouse over the bar graph, they will be given some information about a specific bar including its quantity and year. When a user clicks on the bar, the donut visualization will appear along with a legend. Again, the donut chart also allows the user to hover each color with their mouse and be given information about the graph's quantity and category. The process of creating the chart was quite straightforward as this was an idea I already had in mind implementing since assignment 1 (it was one of the sketches). However some design changes had to be made (like turning the pie into a donut) in order to make things more eye appealing.

(Second linked view when you select a color)
<img width="441" alt="2" src="https://github.com/abonilla1215/CDPH-environmental-complaints/assets/124089151/2b27d3b9-2440-4e0c-bf61-e0c9ef08cff4">

The provided linked visualization offers a dynamic and interactive exploration of complaint data. It incorporates various interaction mechanisms and methods to enhance user engagement. Users can interact with the data by selecting a specific year, which dynamically updates the visualization to display information for the chosen year. The color encoding of the visualization is dynamically mapped to represent the count of complaint types, with different colors indicating different complaint types. The bar chart provides an overview of the total count of complaints for each year, while the heatmap displays the count of complaints for each complaint type within the selected year.

In terms of methods, the bar chart aggregates the total count of complaints for each year, providing a summarized view of the data. The heatmap applies a filter to the data based on the selected year from the bar chart, ensuring that only data for the chosen year is displayed, allowing for a more focused analysis. The selection of a year in the bar chart triggers the linkage between the two charts, enabling users to explore specific years and their corresponding complaint data. Users can navigate through available years by selecting from the bar chart, allowing them to explore trends and patterns over different time periods.

The visualizations are arranged vertically, allowing both charts to be viewed simultaneously. This layout facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the data. To prevent over-plotting and maintain visual clarity, the dataset was limited to the most recent five full years of data, and the complaint types were also restricted. This approach ensures that the visualization remains informative and interpretable. Notably, the attributes being visualized in both the bar chart and heat map include the top four most frequent complaint types, along with the total count of complaints, providing valuable insights into the most prevalent issues. The creation of this diagram was a process spanning a couple of hours. Initially, it encompassed all complaint types, but this led to over-plotting issues, prompting a refinement to focus solely on the top four most frequent complaints. As a creative touch, the design also incorporates an interactive stacked bar chart complemented by a heat map for added depth and interactivity.

(Third link when you select inspector number 9)

This is another multi linked visualization that focuses on the inspectors who have investigated the complaints made throughout the chicago location. This graph contains two charts: a pie chart and a point chart. The first graph shows the ID number of inspectors and the second focuses on the total number of reports made by street names. There are a large number of inspectors contained in the data, so the first pie chart will only focus on the 10 inspectors who investigate the most complaints. The goal of this visualization is for the user to see which inspector verifies the most complaints, to which they can correlate to which location they often visit. This can help the user analyze trends, discover correlations, and possibly find any misconceptions between two inspectors.
The visualization is also interactive. The pie chart initially starts off as a little faded, but if the user were to click on a slice, it would become highlighted. Doing so would cause a second graph (point graph) to appear right under neath. Each graph is unique to each slice and every label has their own unique color code. Upon further analysis, we see that inspector number 9 has the most reports compared to the others. A user can ask "What location does this inspector frequent the most?" this is when they can select inspector number 9 and discover that Grand is their most frequent location. 

(Fourht link + spacial when you select air pollution and 2008)
<img width="468" alt="4" src="https://github.com/abonilla1215/CDPH-environmental-complaints/assets/124089151/37f8650c-30a0-4158-b560-50b6c886dbdd">


This graph implements a combination of visual elements such as spatial and temporal. The graph goes over the location of where each complaint type is reported along with what year. The graph shows a colored circle around a map containing a number, each number represents the total number of complaints reported on that area. The goal of the graph is to inform users of the kind of problems they can encounter in certain parts of chicago. This allows them to analyze trends, create correlations, and provide better guidance whether or not they want to invest in that area (for things such as living there or starting a business). A user can ask "What area contains the most air pollution?" then they can select their desired category. Using the linked view chart from the bottom, it states that in 2001 there was a huge spike of air pollution complaints, thus the user can use the year bar drag interaction to discover the areas that have reported it.

The visualization is also interactive by providing users selective control of how they want to filter their graph. It contains a drop down menu at the top for the user to select the complaint type they wish to analyze. Clicking on a type will change the map's visualization. Clicking over a circle will provide a user of the complaint ID and date of the complaint type. At the bottom of the graph there is a slider that controls the year. The user can play with the year slide bar and see the different type trends happening for their selected complaint type. This graph originally started out as a heat map, but we wanted to improve it by adding  HTML elements. The original idea of the map was already thought of in our sketches.

(Simple not interactive lollipop graph)
<img width="955" alt="5" src="https://github.com/abonilla1215/CDPH-environmental-complaints/assets/124089151/36f7af5c-c6cc-44d4-8b63-b3ed9a6b70e4">


The graph visualizes the trend of complaints over time, employing attributes such as complaint date, total count of complaints, and various complaint types. Each complaint type is distinguished by a distinct color, aiding in easy differentiation. The x-axis displays chronological dates, while the y-axis quantifies the count of complaints. This graphical representation covers both the time aspect, showcasing when complaints are made, and the distribution aspect, offering insights into how complaints are spread over time. This is actually a more refined and filtered version as the original one we created back for assignment 3 was clustered with a lot of data. The point of this graph is to inform users of the grand total amount of complaints reported per year but at the same time show the user what specific complaint types were made that year too. This is like a more unique version of our first graph in terms of style, but we must also mention that it is not interactive. The thought process of creating this was simple as it was already created for our last assignment, we only had to clean it up to make it more presentable. 

(Simple not interactive line graph)
<img width="297" alt="6" src="https://github.com/abonilla1215/CDPH-environmental-complaints/assets/124089151/a94f9a44-cd90-467f-81ea-2aac6e41b625">


This graph is more of a niche design as it uses direction to obtain its data. The visualization is overall a line chart that uses directions (N, E, S, W) for its input. The chart holds the total amount of complaints made for each direction throughout time (years). What we like about this design is that even though appearance wise it is a 2D graph, it gives you a sense of spatial visualization because you can see what directions in Chicago receive the most complaints upon further analysis. The goal of this graph is to provide the user a sense of general direction of which areas in Chicago receive the most complaints. From the graph, they can discover trends and find correlations between years and directions. The thought process of creating this was simple as it was an idea from our original sketches for assignment 1.
